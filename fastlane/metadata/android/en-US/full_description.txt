This application provides the ability to encrypt and decrypt files within its native interface, as well as encrypt and decrypt text in any app that supports text processing. If the current app does not support text processing, you can use the “Share” option to perform encryption and decryption without leaving the original application.
Encrypted or decrypted text is displayed in a pop-up window that allows you to copy it easily. The application implements AES-256 GCM and DES encryption algorithms, and work is underway to integrate post-quantum methods. It also offers an automatic 256-bit key generator and the option to import or export keys via QR codes.
